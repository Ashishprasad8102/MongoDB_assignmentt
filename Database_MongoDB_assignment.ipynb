    "2>MongoDB has several key features that make it a popular NoSQL database. Let's explore some of its main features:\n",
    "\n",
    "Document-Oriented:\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB is a document-oriented database, where data is stored in flexible, JSON-like documents.\n",
    "Documents group related data together, allowing for hierarchical relationships and easier data retrieval.\n",
    "No Schema Constraints:\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB does not require a fixed schema, providing flexibility in data models.\n",
    "Documents in a collection can have different structures, allowing for dynamic and evolving data.\n",
    "Scalability:\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB is designed for horizontal scaling, distributing data across multiple servers or clusters.\n",
    "Supports sharding, which allows for efficient distribution of data to handle increased load and storage requirements.\n",
    "High Performance:\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB's design and architecture prioritize high-speed read and write operations.\n",
    "Optimized for real-time applications and high-throughput workloads.\n",
    "Indexing:\n",
    "\n",
    "Supports various types of indexes to improve query performance and allow for efficient data retrieval.\n",
    "Indexes can be created on single fields or combinations of fields.\n",
    "Aggregation Framework:\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB provides a powerful aggregation framework that enables data processing and manipulation within the database.\n",
    "Allows complex data transformations, grouping, filtering, and computations.\n",
    "Ad Hoc Queries:\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB supports ad hoc queries, enabling users to perform flexible and dynamic searches on the data without \n",
    "predefined queries or views.\n",
    "Geospatial Queries:\n",
    "\n",
    "Includes built-in support for geospatial data and geospatial queries.\n",
    "Enables location-based queries and geospatial indexing for efficient spatial data handling.\n",
    "Automatic Replication:\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB supports automatic data replication through replica sets.\n",
    "Ensures data redundancy, fault tolerance, and high availability.\n",
    "Flexible Data Model:\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB's BSON (Binary JSON) format allows support for various data types, including arrays and nested documents.\n",
    "Makes it suitable for storing complex data structures.\n",
    "JSON-like Queries:\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB queries use a JSON-like syntax, which is familiar and easy to use for developers."
